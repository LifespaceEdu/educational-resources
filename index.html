                1. <strong>Socioeconomic</strong>: This means it's related to money and social status.
                2. <strong>Geologic</strong>: This has to do with the physical structure of the Earth.
                3. <strong>Climatic</strong>: This is about long-term weather patterns in an area.
                
                Before Hawaiians had contact with Europeans and before the Hawaiian government was illegally overthrown, they lived in a highly organized and sustainable system.`,

                This created what we call the Coloniality of Power - where outside forces set up new rules that took away Hawaiian people's rights to their own land and way of life.`,

                Each ahupuaʻa was a self-sustaining unit - it contained all the resources that an entire community needed. This included:
                - Sea salt and fish
                - Land for farming kalo (taro) or sweet potato
                - Koa and other trees grown in the upland
                
                People who lived on the coast would trade with those living up the mountain. They traded fish for wood to build homes and canoes.`,

                The Hawaiians practiced:
                - Aloha (respect)
                - Laulima (cooperation)
                - Mālama (stewardship)
                
                This created pono (balance). The ancient Hawaiians shared knowledge and resources, enjoyed abundance, and even had time for art and recreation during Makahiki (the harvest season).`,

                <strong>Wao Nahele</strong> - The ancient forest, left remote for natural fauna to control and provide resources.
                
                <strong>Wao Lau Wale</strong> - The forest that was tended by people. It was terraced all the way up the mountain to the spring sources.`,

                The important part for the farmer was not the amount of water coming into their system. It was the amount and quality of water that was put back into the system for the users below.
                
                This is called a sacred responsibility to downstream users.`,

                Mitigation: Help people adjust to a barrier or problem.
                Example: Give people bottled water when their tap water is poisoned.
                
                Transformation: Remove the barrier completely.
                Example: Fix the water system so tap water is clean for everyone.
                
                True justice means transformation - fixing the conditions that harm people, not just helping people survive harmful conditions.`,
